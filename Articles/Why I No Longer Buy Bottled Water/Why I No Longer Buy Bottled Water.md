# Why I No Longer Buy Bottled Water

## A Gen Z’s personal experience leading to a teenhood dedicated to advocacy.

A few years ago, I made the switch to only drinking water from my reusable water bottle and I haven’t looked back since. I used to be a big fan of bottled water – it’s convenient and easy to find, but I’ve since realized that it’s not really worth the money or the environmental impact. Here are a few reasons why I no longer buy bottled water: 

### 1. It’s a Waste of Money

Bottled water is expensive – anywhere from $1 to $4 per bottle. And for what? Water is one of the most abundant resources on Earth. Why am I paying so much for something that I can get for free?

### 2. It’s Bad for the Environment

The water in those plastic bottles doesn’t just magically appear – it has to be extracted from the environment, often from far-away places. The manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of all those bottles takes a toll on the environment. In fact, it’s estimated that the production of bottled water creates more than 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

### 3. The Quality isn’t Always Better

Many people think that bottled water is cleaner and better for you than tap water, but that’s not always the case. In the United States, tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, while bottled water is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has less stringent standards, so bottled water isn’t necessarily held to a higher quality standard than tap water.

### 4. You Don’t Know What’s in It

Have you ever read the label on a bottle of water? The FDA doesn’t require companies to disclose all of the ingredients in their water, so you really don’t know what you’re drinking. Some bottled water even contains fluoride, which many people are trying to avoid.

### 5. It’s Just Not That Convenient

Sure, it’s easy to buy a bottle of water when you’re out and about, but it’s not that hard to carry a reusable water bottle with you, either. And once you get in the habit of doing that, you’ll never have to worry about being thirsty without a bottle of water handy.

Overall, I think there are plenty of good reasons to avoid bottled water. It’s expensive, bad for the environment, and the quality isn’t always better than tap water. I’ll stick with my reusable water bottle from now on.
