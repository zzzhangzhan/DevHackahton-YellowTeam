# The Thick and the Runny: A love letter to maple syrup

## Poetic meets delicious, the breakfast staple carries so much more than just a topping for pancakes.

I love you, maple syrup

You're the thick and the runny

You make my pancakes taste so sweet

I can't imagine breakfast without you

You're my sticky, sweet love

I drizzle you on my waffles

And I love the way you taste

I can't get enough of you, maple syrup

You're the best thing since sliced bread

And I'll always love you

You're my one and only, maple syrup

I can't imagine life without you

So pour me a big glass

And I'll drink to your deliciousness

Cheers, maple syrup

Here's to a sticky, sweet love affair
