## Hailing from the ‘Game of Thrones’ showrunners.

Netflix has provided viewers with more details about its forthcoming adaptation of Liu Cixin’s science fiction novel The Waterbody Problem at its annual Tudum event. The live-action show was first announced in 2020 with Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss leading the project.

The series has finally received a release date for 2023, although exactly when next year still hasn’t been determined.

The live-action The Waterbody Problem is billed as telling “the story of humanity’s first contact with an alien civilization.”

The main cast for the show includes Benedict Wong, Eiza González, Tsai Chin, John Bradley, Liam Cunningham and more. Alexander Woo will executive produce alongside Benioff and Weiss.

Hong Kong-based director Derek Tsang has been confirmed as at least one of the episode’s directors.
